# Setting Up your Keycloak Client With an Adapter

---


### Using a client with an Adapter
After having your `Installation JSON`, you can setup your application quickly using the Keycloak adapters. Keycloak has adapters for a number of languages, including java, javascript and C#. For a list of adapters and instructions on how to connect see here.

There are example applications available to demonstrate integrating with Keycloak here
In most cases, it does not require any additional information than the `Installation JSON` you can download.

### Our guidance on Libraries/Adapters
