# Introduction

Thanks for visiting this site. We are currently focused on building guides and release notes here. Stay tuned as we develop more

Please visit the [Common hosted Single Sign on
(CSS) App](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests/) if you are looking for integration with a login component. The process is completely self-serve and takes only minutes. You will need an IDIR to log in and you _should_ be a product owner, product admin, or team lead for a project. Once the automated provisioning is complete, your client details will be available securely through the web app (\*)

**(\*) Note for BCeID and Digital Credential Requests**

The Pathfinder SSO team will provision your DEV and TEST clients right away. You will be provided the client name and secret for each environment via a secure channel. The PROD client will be set up after receiving approval from the IDIM team for BCeID requests or from the Digital Identity Trust team for Digital Credential requests, as applicable.

**(\*) Note for Azure IDIR Requests**

Please note the provisioning process is the same as IDIR.
