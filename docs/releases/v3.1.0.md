# CSS v3.1.0

### New Features 🎉

-   Added What's New section in [Common Hosted Single Sign-on (CSS)](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests) home page
-   Updated label and description from "Azure IDIR" to "IDIR - MFA". The orignal "Azure IDIR" could be misinterpreted as a different IDP, but in fact, it is a different way to log in with IDIR. 


### Bug fixes and enhancement 🐛

-   Fixed an issue that error happens when SSO admin restores a CSS API account
-   Fixed a backend issue such that integration IDP selections are in sync between CSS APP and Keycloak


### Miscellaneous 🧩
-   Added internal checking on consistency between CSS APP and Keycloak
