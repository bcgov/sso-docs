# CSS v4.11.0
2025-02-06

### New Features 🎉
- On-premises IDIR is no longer an identity provider option for new integrations. We still offer integrations with IDIR - MFA with the benefit of MFA (multi-factor authentication). This is a step-up security-wise from on-premises IDIR. Click [here](https://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/css-docs/Our-Partners-the-Identity-Providers/#what-are-identity-providers) to learn more about identity providers.
- Project Name now can be changed for SAML integrations

### Bug fixes and enhancement 🐛
- Fixed issues on BC Service Card (BCSC) integrations. Before the fixes, some BCSC integrations could not be updated or deleted. 

### Miscellaneous 🧩
- Stabilized CSS app automation testing with code refactoring
