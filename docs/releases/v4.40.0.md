# CSS v4.40.0
2025-05-05

### New Features 🎉
- Added a new end point to get a list of BCeID users by querying for an integration in target environment. The query can be searched by guid, displayName, username, or email. Existing BCeID Users end points are still supported in CSS App API v1 but deprecated. Clients are recommended to update with this new end point to query BCeID users with integration ID bounded.  See CSS App API [Users](https://api.loginproxy.gov.bc.ca/openapi/swagger#/Users/get_integrations__integrationId___environment__bceid_users) for more details.

### Bug fixes and enhancement 🐛
- Fixed an issue that a draft integration is not listed under My Dashboard if the integration has Project Team toggled on, but without specifying the Project Team.
- Fixed an issue on Assign Users to Roles tab that the IDP selection drop-down reverts to the default IDIR when the environment is changed.
- Fixed some UI overlapping and refreshing issues under Technical Details and Role Management tabs.

### Miscellaneous 🧩
- Tech Debts: cleaned up browser console log warning when loading CSS app.
