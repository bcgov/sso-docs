# CSS v4.20.0
2025-03-19

### New Features 🎉
- Refined behavior on IDP selection to give clients flexibility to maintain an integration. Now BCeID and GitHub can be removed from an integration. Removing BCeID and GitHub will void the prod environment approval status. If later the removed IDP is added back, a new approval process is required.
- BCSC now can be removed from an integration if it's not approved for prod environment yet.
- Email notification on integration updates now includes a list of changes made for the update

### Bug fixes and enhancement 🐛
- CSS API Roles end points now can accept forward slash ('/') in a role name. A role name requires valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Miscellaneous 🧩
- Tech Debts: updated on libraries and build process
