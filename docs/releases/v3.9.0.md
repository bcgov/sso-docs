# CSS v3.12.0
2024-9-27

### New Features üéâ
-   Added BC Service Card (Alpha) as an Identity Provider option in standard service. Please refer to [Identity Providers](https://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/css-docs/Our-Partners-the-Identity-Providers#what-are-identity-providers?utm_source=sso-wiki&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=retirement-notice-sso) and [BC Services Card](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-docs/advanced/bc-services-card) for more information.
-   Digital Credential integrations now do not require a production approval process. However, clients still need to engage with DIT to learn about the Digital Credential Configuration ID. You can contact them at ditp.support@gov.bc.ca

### Bug fixes and enhancement üêõ
-  Being Alpha released in v3.6.2, with Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK) 24 deployed in production, Digital Credential is now supported as MVP in standard service. Please refer to [Digital Credentials](https://mvp.developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/css-docs/#digital-credentials) for MVP limitations
-  Fixed an issue for Digital Credential integrations, that in some cases, a user need to log in again if there are other users logged in from different applications.

### Miscellaneous üß©
-  Automation is now merged into the same code base with application and full regression runs every week.
